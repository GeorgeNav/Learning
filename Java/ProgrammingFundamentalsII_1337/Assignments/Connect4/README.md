Connect 4, The Group Project
Connect 4 is a game that is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe. The goal of the game is to connect 4 stones to form a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Whoever achieves that first wins the game.
Program Requirements:
1. The board size should be adjustable. You can use a menu item to do it, or you can use a setting dialog before you display the board. Menu item is preferred. The board size should be limited from 5 to 9. Donâ€™t forget to change your underline data model that represent your board accordingly.
2. Your program should have a way for the user to choose if your program will play the first move or its opponent will play the first play. If the computer plays first, your program should find a play and display it before the opponent can play.
3. Your program must be able to judge if a game has ended. No player should be able to continue playing if a game is already ended. 
4. After every move by the opponent, the game should be evaluated, if the game has not ended, your program should generate a move and displayed, and judged to see if the computer wins.
5. Your program should be easily extendable. If I want to change the connect 4 to connect 5, most your code should be reusable.
Deliverables:
1. Design documentation
2. Class codes, with Javadoc comments included and inline comments.
3. Html files from Javadoc comments.
