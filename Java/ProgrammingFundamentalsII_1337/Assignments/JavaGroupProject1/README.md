First Assignment Instructions (Non-group)
 
In this programming assignment, we are going to use a java class downloaded from internet as a base, and tic-tac-toe game.

This assignment is a warm-up project preparing you for the group project. So instead of one single class, you should break it down to several classes. This way, when you start your group project you can have several parts going parallel without stepping on each other's toes.

For example, you can have a separate event handler as a public class instead of a private inner class. You can have a class handling playing algorithm. you can have a class that handles the status checking. E.g. the game should not continue if one player wins or it is a draw.

For this assignment, I want a UML diagram turned in with your code. If you don't know what a UML diagram is, check the book.

Also, I want a short description of your playing algorithm. For example, find a point so that my play will block most lines of opponents' stones. Or find a point so my stones have most active long lines (2 for tic-tac-toe, more for group project. This can be a simple paragraph with bullet points or it can be a full report.

You don't have to start with the attached java class as your base. You can use anything. However, your program should do the following:

1. Display a dialog so that the human player to choose if he wants to play the first move or second move.

2. Display a tic-tac-toe board. If the computer plays first, with the computer's move.

3. After every move by the human player, your program should display that move, pause a short time, display the computer's next move.

4. When the game ended, either if one of the players wins or no more space available (draw), display it in the status bar and ready to move on to a new game.
